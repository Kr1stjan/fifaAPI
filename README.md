# FifaAPI
This API is going to provide updated data of teams for developers to create fun applications or just develop something for personal use. Teams are fetched from online and stored in MongoDB.

## Usage
```bash

# Install dependencies listed in package.json
$ npm install

# Run dev 
$ npm run dev

```
#### TODO
* Get teams from online
* Move MongoDB to local
